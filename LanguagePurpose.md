### Why was the language created?
Created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf, it was designed to track page views to his online resume website. It was originally called “Personal Home Page Tools”. As time went on, more functionality was desired and he began to add on functionality such as database interaction. This allowed people to make dynamic interactive web applications. In 1995, the source code was released allowing people to contribute to it and fix bugs.

### What problems was the language trying to address?
Rasmus Lerdorf needed a way to track pageviews on his resume website, but it has now turned into a larger code base allowing dynamic web applications to be built.

### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
PHP as we know it today is the successor to PHP/FI, known as PHP Forms Interpreter.
