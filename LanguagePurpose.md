# Language purpose/genesis

## Swift

### Why was the language created?
Apple needed something more resilient and concise than objective-c, dev work started in 2010 by Chris Lattner, the same author of the LLVM compiler. Released in June of 2014.
### What problems was the language trying to address?
Swift was developed to help address common errors like null pointers and provided some nice syntactic sugar to avoid pyramids of doom.
### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
Swift was the successor to the OBjective-C language, Swift for the Mac currently still runs in the Objective-C runtime but an open source version for Linux no longer runs or even ships with the Objective-C runtime.

## PHP

### Why was the language created?
Created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf, it was designed to track page views to his online resume website. It was originally called “Personal Home Page Tools”. As time went on, more functionality was desired and he began to add on functionality such as database interaction. This allowed people to make dynamic interactive web applications. In 1995, the source code was released allowing people to contribute to it and fix bugs.

### What problems was the language trying to address?
Rasmus Lerdorf needed a way to track pageviews on his resume website, but it has now turned into a larger code base allowing dynamic web applications to be built.

### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
PHP as we know it today is the successor to PHP/FI, known as PHP Forms Interpreter.
